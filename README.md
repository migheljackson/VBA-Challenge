# VBA-Challenge

This project was a challenge indeed in trying to find an efficient way to complete it.  I settled on using multiple separate functions and created a multi-item dictionary using a class module.  That allowed me to use a single dictionary to sum, and display the data for each ticker, and then perform mathematical operations all within the same loop.
